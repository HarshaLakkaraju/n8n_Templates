# n8n Templates

This repository contains a collection of JSON-based workflow templates for [n8n](https://n8n.io). Each template demonstrates practical automation examples and can be customized or extended for different use cases.

## Overview

1. **Templates**  
   - Each JSON file in the repository corresponds to a workflow template.  
   - Designed to showcase how to configure nodes, set up logic flows, and transform data.

2. **Structure**  
   - Every template is a standalone JSON file located at the root directory of this repository.  
   - The main JSON file you will see contains predefined nodes, triggers, and logic to help you quickly set up workflows in n8n.

3. **Usage**  
   - Clone or download this repository.  
   - In n8n, go to “Import” → “From File” and select the JSON template you wish to use.  
   - After import, review each node’s configuration and credentials before execution.

4. **Customization**  
   - Update nodes to match your required credentials (API keys or login details).  
   - Adjust node parameters (filters, conditions, mappings) to fit your specific data flows.  
   - Add or remove nodes as needed to create more advanced workflows.

## JSON Template Example

Each JSON file follows n8n’s workflow structure (simplified example shown below for illustration):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "someParameter": "value"
      },
      "name": "Example Node",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-exampleNode",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [
        200,
        300
      ]
    }
  ],
  "connections": {}
}
```
